`b` is binary or a go package that provides a set of utilities for managing and executing binary files. It is particularly useful for binaries hosted on GitHub.

The package includes a `Binary` struct that represents a binary file, including its name, file path, version, and other related properties. You can create a `Binary` struct by providing the binary name and version, and then use the `EnsureBinary` method to ensure that the binary is available on the system.
</p>

&nbsp;

### üöÄ Quickstart

If you have Go installed, you can build and install the latest version of `b` with:

```bash
go install github.com/buyoio/b/b@latest
```

> Binaries built in this way do not have the correct version embedded. Use our prebuilt binaries or check out [.goreleaser.yaml](./.goreleaser.yaml) to learn how to embed it yourself.

&nbsp;

### üìö Import 

To use this package, you need to import it in your Go project:

```go
import "github.com/buyoio/b/pkg/binary"
```

The `Binary` struct represents a binary file, including its name, file path, version, and other related properties. You can create a `Binary` struct by providing the binary name and version:

```go
bin := binary.Binary{Name: "mybinary", Version: "1.0.0"}
bin.EnsureBinary()
```

Have a look into [pkg/binary](./pkg/binary/) for more details.
